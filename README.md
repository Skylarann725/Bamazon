# Welcome to Bamazon
This application uses Node.js and MySQL to emulate an online shopping experience.

How to Install and Run the Application

Install the game by cloning this repository and navigating to the correct file in your command line (using terminal or git bash).

Create a database using MySQL called Bamazon and copy the code in the bamazon.sql file to create your Bamazon database with tables and inventory. (Use Workbench/Sequel Pro or MySQL in the command line).

There are two dashboards to this application - Customer View or Manager View. 

Run the application by typing either node bamazonCustomer.js or node bamazonManager.js in the command line (remember to npm init and install the modules so that the game runs correctly).

Follow the prompts to make purchases or manage the inventory.

See demo below to see how this application functions.
